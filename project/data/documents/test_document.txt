The Solar System

The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter.

Planets

The inner solar system contains four terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are small and rocky. The outer solar system is home to the four giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Jupiter is by far the largest planet in our solar system - more than 11 times wider than Earth and composed mainly of hydrogen and helium gas.

The Eight Planets

1. Mercury - The smallest planet, closest to the Sun
2. Venus - Similar in size to Earth, hottest planet
3. Earth - Our home planet, the only known world with life
4. Mars - The Red Planet, potential for human colonization
5. Jupiter - Gas giant, largest planet in our system
6. Saturn - Known for its prominent rings
7. Uranus - Rotates on its side
8. Neptune - The windiest planet, farthest from the Sun

Moons

Many planets have natural satellites, or moons. Earth has one moon. Mars has two small moons. Jupiter has 95 known moons, making it the planet with the most moons. Saturn has 146 known moons and a system of rings.

Asteroids and Comets

Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt, containing millions of rocky objects. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, home to icy bodies and dwarf planets like Pluto.

The Sun

The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (yellow dwarf) that comprises about 99.86% of the system's mass. Solar energy drives most of the weather on Earth's surface and powers plant growth on the planet.
