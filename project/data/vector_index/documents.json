    "content": "Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nWhat is Machine Learning?\n\nMachine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML systems can learn and adapt to new data without human intervention.\n\nMachine learning uses algorithms and statistical models to analyze patterns in data. These algorithms can identify relationships between variables that humans might not easily detect. When exposed to more data, machine learning models can improve their accuracy and performance automatically.\n\nKey Characteristics of Machine Learning:\n\n1. Automatic Learning: ML systems learn from data automatically without needing explicit instructions for every task.",

Pattern Recognition: ML excels at finding hidden patterns in large datasets.\n\nTypes of Machine Learning\n\nSupervised Learning:\n\nSupervised learning involves training algorithms with labeled data. The algorithm learns from examples where both input and correct output are provided. Common applications include classification (assigning data to categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). For example, predicting house prices based on features like size and location is a regression task.\n\nUnsupervised Learning:",

Clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction are common unsupervised learning tasks.\n\nReinforcement Learning:\n\nReinforcement learning trains agents to make sequential decisions. The agent learns by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. This approach is used in game AI, robotics, and autonomous systems.\n\nDeep Learning:\n\nDeep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to process data. Deep learning is particularly effective for processing unstructured data like images, audio, and text.\n\nReal-World Applications of Machine Learning",

It enables AI systems to answer questions based strictly on provided documents, eliminating hallucinations and ensuring factual accuracy.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Document Ingestion**: Automatically processes PDF, TXT, and Markdown files\n\n- **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligently splits documents while preserving context\n\n- **Vector Embeddings**: Uses Sentence-Transformers for high-quality semantic embeddings",
