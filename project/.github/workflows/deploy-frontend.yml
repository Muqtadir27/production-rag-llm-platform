# GitHub Actions workflow for deploying frontend to GitHub Pages
# 
# This workflow:
# 1. Runs on every push to the main branch
# 2. Installs Node.js dependencies
# 3. Builds the Next.js app as static export
# 4. Deploys to the gh-pages branch
#
# The frontend will be available at: https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
#
# IMPORTANT: Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:
# Settings > Pages > Source: Deploy from a branch > Branch: gh-pages / (root)
